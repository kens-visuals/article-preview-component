## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Vanilla JS
- SCSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This was a good chance to practice Vanilla JS, however, I'm looking forward to practice more of it in other projects. I want to code in Vanilla JS as much as possible, before moving on to a JS framework/library

### Useful resources

- [My DOM Cheatsheet](https://kens-visuals.notion.site/kens-visuals/DOM-Cheatsheet-d13010855d2c462492b53fe9c56339c4) - This is a very basic DOM cheetheet that I made on Notion for such small projects, feel free to use for your next projects.
